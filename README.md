### Testing Time in Java

> Time isn’t the main thing. It’s the only thing - Miles Davis

Birthdays are the best! Today we're going to write some tested code that creates birthday notifications for people. Let's explore how we test time based classes with the
`java.time` API.

### Set Up

#### The Person
Let's start with a simple person definition, for our purposes, we just need a name and birthday. Since Java 8, 
the standard date/time API is JSR-310, so we'll go ahead and model birthday as a `LocalDate`. Local date represents
a year, month, and day without information about the time-zone or offset, which is perfect for a birthday.

```java
public record Person(
    String name,
    LocalDate birthday
) {}
```

#### The Notification

A notification consists of a title and a message. Think of it as something you see when you log into a website, or a push 
notification destined for your mobile device.

Given the following interface definition, we want to create a class that is a `NotificationGenerator<Person>`, 
which will produce a notification when it is called on the day of the person's birthday. On any other day the 
generator will produce `Optional.empty()`.

```java
package com.wwt.testing.time.notifications;

import java.util.Optional;

@FunctionalInterface
public interface NotificationGenerator<T> {
    Optional<Notification> generate(T input);
}
```

### What day is it?

In order to test our new `BirthdayNotificationGenerator` we'll need to be able to control time itself. Namely,
we want to be able to externally provide the current date, rather than using a static call like `LocalDate.now()`. This 
enables us to verify the notification is only sent when appropriate.

#### Enter the java.time.Clock

The `java.time.Clock` is responsible for supplying the current instant using a time-zone. Each of the 
date-time constructs in `java.time.*` have a factory method named `now()` that takes the clock as a parameter, which
will create the date/time at the instant provided by the clock.

### The Class Under Test

It feels like we know enough to start building the class under test. Let's make a class that implements `NotificationGenerator<Person>`
and takes a `java.time.Clock` as a constructor parameter, so we can set the time.

```java
package com.wwt.testing.time.notifications;

import com.wwt.testing.time.Person;

import java.time.Clock;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.MonthDay;
import java.util.Optional;

public class BirthdayNotificationGenerator implements NotificationGenerator<Person> {

    public BirthdayNotificationGenerator(Clock clock) {
    }
    
    @Override
    public Optional<Notification> generate(Person person) {
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}
```

### The First Tests

As always, lets create a test class for our `BirthdayNotificationGenerator` and instantiate the class under test. The first
decision we're going to need to make is which `Clock` to use? The `java.time.Clock` comes with a [fixed implementation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Clock.html#fixed-java.time.Instant-java.time.ZoneId-), 
that will always produce the same instant once configured, but since we went with constructor injection, we don't want 
to have to recreate the test instance in each test case. 

[ThreeTen-Extra](https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/), an optional part of the JSR-310 project, provides a [mutable clock](https://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/MutableClock.html)
implementation that lets you set the current time. That seems like a good fit for our needs, so we can add a test dependency in our `build.gradle` on `"org.threeten:threeten-extra:1.6.0"` and get testing!

```java
class BirthdayNotificationTest {
    private final MutableClock clock = MutableClock.epochUTC();
    private final BirthdayNotificationGenerator testObject = new BirthdayNotificationGenerator(clock);
}
```

For our first tests, we should verify: 
1. A notification is generated on a person's birthday
1. A notification is not generated when it isn't a person's birthday

### It's your birthday!
```java
    @Test
    @DisplayName("Should generate notification on birthday")
    void shouldGenerateNotificationOnBirthday() {
        Person person = new Person("Al Einstein", LocalDate.of(1879, 3, 14));
        clock.set(LocalDate.of(2021, 3, 14));

        Optional<Notification> notification = testObject.generate(person);

        assertThat(notification)
                .contains(new Notification("Happy Birthday!", "Have a fabulous birthday Al Einstein!"));
    }
```

Most of these tests will have a similar setup: create a person with a specific birthday, set the clock for the scenario,
generate an optional notification, and verify the results. 

In this example we want to prove that on your birthday, you get a notification. We set Albert's birthday to 3/14/1879, 
the clock to 3/14/2021, and asserted a notification was generated with the expected content.

If we wanted to be more specific, the clock also has a `setInstant(...)` method that allows you to set the clock to an
exact point in time. We only care about the day, so we'll just use the  

Once we pass that test, we'll want to verify that you don't get notified when it isn't your birthday:

```java
@Test
@DisplayName("Should not generate notification when not birthday")
void shouldNotGenerateNotificationWhenNotBirthday() {
    Person person = new Person("Ted Fitzgerald", LocalDate.of(1984, 6, 22));
    clock.set(LocalDate.of(2021, 3, 15));

    Optional<Notification> notifications = testObject.generate(person);

    assertThat(notifications).isEmpty();
}
```

The implementation I came up with to pass those two basic tests looked something like this: 

```java
package com.wwt.testing.time.notifications;

import com.wwt.testing.time.Person;

import java.time.Clock;
import java.time.MonthDay;
import java.util.Optional;

public class BirthdayNotificationGenerator implements NotificationGenerator<Person> {
    private final Clock clock;

    public BirthdayNotificationGenerator(Clock clock) {
        this.clock = clock;
    }

    @Override
    public Optional<Notification> generate(Person person) {
        return Optional.of(person)
                .filter(this::isBirthday)
                .map(this::createNotification);
    }

    private Notification createNotification(Person person) {
        var message = String.format("Have a fabulous birthday %s!", person.name());
        return Notification.of("Happy Birthday!", message);
    }

    private boolean isBirthday(Person person) {
        var now = MonthDay.now(clock);
        return MonthDay.from(person.birthday()).equals(now);
    }
}
```

Let's take a quick look at the `isBirthday(Person person)` method. In JSR-310 there is a MonthDay class that represents 
a month day combo. `MonthDay` has a `now(...)` factory method that takes a clock to provide the current month and day. 
We use injected clock, so the time set by our `MutableClock` in our test configuration gets used.

### Testing edge cases

Looks great, ship it; right? We have one more consideration, people born Feb 29th on a leap year will only be notified 
once every four years with the current implementation. We don't want to forget about them!

```java
@Test
@DisplayName("On normal year, notify Feb 29th birthday on March 1st")
void leapBirthdayNotifiedOnMarchFirstOnNormalYear() {
    Person person = new Person("Ja Rule", LocalDate.of(1976, 2, 29));
    clock.set(LocalDate.of(2021, 3, 1));

    Optional<Notification> notifications = testObject.generate(person);

    assertThat(notifications)
            .contains(new Notification("Happy Birthday!", "Have a fabulous birthday Ja Rule!"));
}
```

The procedure is the same, but in this case we'll create a person with a birthday on February 29th, and verify that on a
non-leap year they get notified on March 1st instead.

We'll wrap up testing with the following two cases, and we'll be ready to ship:
- On leap year, you should be notified of a Feb 29th birthday on the exact day
- On leap year, you should be not be notified on March 1st
